# 🔋 EnergyTracker

## 🌟 The Story Behind the Project

**EnergyTracker** was born out of a personal battle.

As a developer living with **Fibromyalgia** and other chronic illnesses, I realized that traditional "productivity" apps are often discouraging. They focus on how much you can *do*, rather than how much you can *sustain*. In the chronic illness community, we often refer to "Spoon Theory"—the idea that we have a limited amount of energy (spoons) each day.

I built this app to help myself—and others with similar special needs—visualize their daily "HP" (Health Points). It is a tool designed to help you practice **Pacing**, avoid "crash and burn" cycles, and communicate your energy patterns with health professionals.

## ✨ What is EnergyTracker?

EnergyTracker is a desktop companion that treats your energy like a rechargeable battery.

* **Tasks** (Chores, Work, Socializing) consume your HP.
* **Exercises & Rest** (Physical Therapy, Naps, Light Stretching) restore your HP.
* **The Goal** is to stay balanced and avoid hitting 0%.

## 📖 User Guide: How to Manage Your Energy

Whether you are new to tracking or a long-time "Spoonie," here is how to get the most out of the app:

### 1. Setting Your "100%" (Initial Setup)

Everyone’s baseline is different. One person’s "full energy" might be another person’s "50%."

* Go to **Settings**.
* Set your **Initial HP**. This represents how you feel on a "good day."
* As you learn your limits, you can come back here to adjust your baseline.

### 2. Planning Your Day (Adding Tasks)

When you add a task, you assign it an **Energy Weight**:

* **Low (1-3 HP):** Light tasks like answering an email or brushing teeth.
* **Medium (4-7 HP):** Moderate tasks like cooking a meal or a short phone call.
* **High (8-10+ HP):** Heavy tasks like grocery shopping or a doctor's appointment.
* **Logic:** When you check a task as "Done," the **Energy Ring** will automatically decrease, showing you exactly how much "battery" you have left for the rest of the day.

### 3. Understanding the Energy Ring (Colors)

The central ring provides instant visual feedback:

* 🟢 **Green (70% - 100%):** You are in a safe zone. Feel free to engage in planned activities.
* 🟡 **Yellow (30% - 69%):** Use caution. You are spending your energy quickly. Consider moving some tasks to tomorrow.
* 🔴 **Red (Below 30%):** Warning zone. Your body needs rest. Prioritize recovery immediately to avoid a flare-up.

### 4. Recovery & Recharging

If you do a restorative activity (like Physical Therapy or a meditation session):

* Log it in the **Exercise Manager**.
* Completing these will **add HP back** to your ring, reflecting the benefits of rest and proper movement.

### 5. Tracking Long-Term Trends

Use the **Monthly Tracker** to look for patterns.

* *Example:* "I notice every Wednesday my ring is in the Red. Why? Ah, I have three back-to-back meetings that day."
* This data is incredibly helpful to show your doctor to explain how your fatigue impacts your daily life.

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

* **100% Offline**: Your health data is yours alone. It is stored in a file named `energy_tracker.db` on your computer. Nothing is ever uploaded to the internet.
* **No Medical Advice**: This app is a tracking tool, not a doctor. Always listen to your body over the app’s numbers.
